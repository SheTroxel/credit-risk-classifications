# Credit Risk Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis

To minimize credit risk to the overall loan portfolio for a peer-to-peer lending services company, historical lending activity data was evaluated to develop a machine learning model that could accurately identify the creditworthiness of borrowers. The historical data included a loan status column which identified which loans were healthy (1) and which loans had defaulted (0). 

To create a model that can accurately identify the creditworthiness of borrows, the historical lending data was imported into a pandas DataFrame. From the DataFrame, the "loan_status" was select for the label set (`y`) and for the features set (`X`), the remaining columns of data were used. Once the label and feature sets were identified, the data was split into Training and Testing sets. Training sets are used to train the model in determining if a loan is healthy(1) or not (0). The testing sets are used to ensure that all new data coming into the model is evaluated acurrately.
